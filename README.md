Project Title: Library & Zoo Management System
Description:
This Python project is divided into two parts:

Library Management CLI – A command-line tool to manage a simple library system using core Python concepts.

Zoo Management System – A program that models animals and their environments using object-oriented programming.

Part 1: Library Management CLI
Users can add books, list available books, search by title or author, borrow, and return books.

Books are stored as dictionaries in a list.

Covers Python basics: variables, lists, dictionaries, functions, loops, conditionals, and error handling.

Part 2: Zoo Management System
Models animals and enclosures using OOP.

Includes a base Animal class and subclasses like Lion or Elephant.

Demonstrates encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Goal:
To demonstrate understanding of both procedural and object-oriented programming in Python through practical applications.
